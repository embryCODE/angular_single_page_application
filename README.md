## Project Instructions

*From Treehouse:* 

In this project, you’ll create a Recipe Book single page application (SPA) using AngularJS. To complete the project, you’ll use your knowledge of AngularJS to create controllers, update the provided HTML templates with ng attributes, and create a service that calls into the provided Node.js REST API.

Your AngularJS SPA will be a “front end” or “client” application that complements the provided Node.js “back end” or “server” application. The code for the Node.js application is included as part of this project so you can run the back end server locally. You’re welcome to explore that code, but you won’t have to make any changes to it, so you can treat it as a “black box” (see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_box).

This project will push you to go beyond what is taught in the Angular Basics course. To complete this project, you'll need to use other resources, including but not limited to the official AngularJS documentation(see https://docs.angularjs.org/api). Learning how to ask the right questions and find answers is a key skill that all developers need to know.

Your application will include two screens: a screen that displays a list of recipes and a detail screen that allows the user to add or edit recipes.
